# docker-django-book
Sample book app implementation with docker and django

This app is created for learning purpose on how we can implement django production ready, using docker

1. django-admin startproject bookstore_project .
   --> Adding . will remove creating bookstore_project folder twice

2. Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to start the project, every configuration needs to be there itself.
